# OLAT-M3U8-Link

## About
This Chrome extension adds a 'Copy m3u8 link' button below each video in [OLAT](https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT). This link is needed if you want to open the stream in e.g. [VLC media player](https://github.com/videolan/vlc), as most of the time the built-in media player (in [OLAT](https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT)) is quite slow.

## Installation
This Chrome extension has to be installed manually, as publishing extensions in the Chrome web store causes a registration fee.

1. Download and unpack the zip-file (by clicking the green 'clone or download' button)
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions` (You have to insert this link manually)
3. Activate the 'Developer mode' in the right top corner
4. Click 'Load unpacked' in the top left corner and select the unpacked zip file.

You're done.

## Usage
Just load the extension (as described in [Installation](#installation)). If loaded successfully, this extension automatically adds a button below each video (containing a valid m3u8 link).
