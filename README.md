# OLAT-video-link

## About
This Chrome/Firefox extension adds a 'Copy video link' button below each video in [OLAT](https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT). This link is needed if you want to open the stream in e.g. [VLC media player](https://github.com/videolan/vlc), as most of the time the built-in media player (in [OLAT](https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT)) is quite slow.

## Installation

### Firefox:

Go to this link and click 'Add to Firefox': https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/olat-video-link/

### Chrome:
